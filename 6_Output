# Output
Thus, we have implemented a model that senses rains andautomatically switches on the wiper and adjusts its speedaccording to the intensity of the rain.
As the intensity of therain increases, the speed of the wiper increases to a certainlevel.Themicrocontroller checks for the digital pin and analog pininputs 
of the rain sensor. When there is slight water onthe sensor, the digital pin is set to logic ’0’. This is usedto detect presence of rain water. To check the
intensity ofrain, we monitor the analog pin output of the rain sensor,whose threshold can be adjusted manually through an at-tached Potentiometer to indicate 
how much water should beconsidered as high rain
